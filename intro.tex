Iâ€™ll write this section last.

The overview of Anti Satellite (ASAT) weapons below will cover these
concepts in greater depth.  The most commonly referenced form of ASAT
is a missile with a Kinetic Kill Vehicle (KKV).  Since the concept of
an ASAT that does generate debris vs one that does not generate debris
is important, disparate terms will be employed.  A KKV is,
essentially, a warhead on a missile and not the entire missile system
(certainly not the accompanying radars, launchers, etc), but it is
also the most common ASAT that does generate debris.  For simplicity
KKV will continue to be used to reference ASATs that generate debris.
If the irritation of inaccuracy is distracting, it is recommended that
KKV be thought of as Kessler Kill Vehicle.  ASATs that do not generate
debris, on the other hand, will be referred to as SAFEKILLs.  A
SAFEKILL is an ASAT weapon that is capable of permanently (or at least
indefinitely) eliminating the capabilities provided by the target
spacecraft.
