\section{Recommendation: Alternative Weapons}

To ensure that humanity can continue to kill one another, without
ending civilization, or denying access to space for generations,
``conventional'' arms are required.  Terrestrially, that means rifles
and expendable riflemen, that means tanks and TOW missiles.  In space,
that means ASAT weapons that do not generate debris; that means
SAFEKILLs.  Active, if slow, development of SAFEKILLs (non-debris
generating counterspace weapons) is underway.  The details of those
development processes will not be discussed here as they are likely to
be classified.

The primary attribute being sought is the ability to disable or otherwise deter, either temporarily or permanently, an enemy spacecraft without generating debris.  One critical aspect of temporary disablement/deterrence is the ability to do so for an arbitrary length of time.  Ground-based jamming, for example, does not qualify as it cannot be maintained when the satellite passes out of view.  Space-based jamming from a nearby satellite, on the other hand, does qualify as the attacker can shadow the target indefinitely.

Any attack method that, for example, caused the electrical systems of an enemy spacecraft to falter would qualify.  Any attack method that redirected the target into the atmosphere would also qualify.  A few categories of potential weaponry are discussed.  All of the methods listed below are possible using current levels of technology in commercial industry, and in some cases using currently-deployed satellites.

While this discussion does most certainly revolve around the weaponization of space, it is worth noting that nothing proposed here appears to violate the Outer Space Treaty. (outer-space)

Blockade
In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the world levied a vast array of economic sanctions against Russia and her oligarchs.(find some nytimes article or something summarizing sanctions)  Economic sanctions, blockades, etc are tools of statecraft that are far more nuanced than Tomahawk missiles (precision-guided though they may be).  In a similar manner, it seems worthy to carry the concept of a blockade over to the space arena.  A blockade need not generate any debris; in fact, it need not cause any damage at all.

Any spacecraft (commercial or military) which is independently capable of close approach for an operation such as servicing or refueling could, in principle, use those capabilities for rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) with an adversary.  Several spacecraft could fly formation with a target, thereby limiting its maneuverability and interfering with its mission.  If a bloackading spacecraft is occluding a camera, then its Intelligence Surveillance and Recoinnasance (ISR) mission cannot continue and a maneuver would be required to get a clear view of the target area.  If accelerating in any direction would result in a collision, however, then the target spacecraft would have few options but to endure the blockade.  In addition, the interceptors could interfere with the target's ability to use its sensor payloads, or even shade its solar panels preventing them from charging batteries or cover their thermal radiators making it more difficult for them to cool themselves down.

While this approach is not expected to be useful against scores of smallsats in a resilient constellation, it is likely to be effective against large strategic assets. In this manner, a strategic asset of an adversary could be effectively blockaded.  Even if the target were to take evasive action in an attempt to prevent a successful blockade, a small number of low-cost and refuelable assets could continually harass the target, preventing smooth mission operations, and potentially forcing it to expend all of its valuable propellant.

Physical Disablement
Most terrestrial weaponry capable of physical disablement is kinetic in nature.  That propensity seems to have carried forward to counterspace weaponry: hit the satellite with a fast-moving chunk of missile and the satellite explodes.  Physical disablement without generating debris involves a great deal more finesse and control, and usually the ability to operate in close proximity to the target, known as Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO).

Cyber/Jamming Attacks
Cyber attacks and jamming/spoofing are already a mainstay of military action - as they should be.  In 2022, civilian space infrastructure was attacked by Russia as part of their invasion of Ukraine.  As was outlined in the 2019 publication Big Risks in Small Satellites, a nation at war has a significant incentive to conduct cyber attacks against both civilian and military space infrastructure.  Also, those same civilian organizations lack the necessary economic incentives to secure their spacecraft as those cyber attacks are only expected once it is too late - i.e. once a state of war exists.  Since a specific cyber attack vector can usually be mitigated once known, there is a strong incentive to avoid utilizing that attack until it can be maximally effective.  The single-use nature of cyber attacks could potentially make them less attractive than some of their physical counterparts.

As was illustrated with the Russian hack of Viasat terminals, cyber attacks are a real and effective means of disabling strategic space-based capabilities without generating orbital debris.  Also as discussed in Big Risks in Small Satellites, spacecraft could be hijacked via cyber attack.  It is possible, for example, to hijack commercial spacecraft with the existing ability to represent a national security risk.  The subsequent publication Commercial Space System Security Guidelines begins the discussion of appropriate cyber defenses for commercial spacecraft.
