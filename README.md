# About

I've been working to push development within the DoD of SAFEKILL ASATs
using the physical principles outlined in the paper.  This seems like
a good time to put the underlying principles and motivations out in
the open.


# Building

The `Makefile` is designed to work with a a docker image called
`pdflatex`.  Look for the `PDFTEX` definition in the `Makefile` for
more information.  It puts all generated files into the `BUILD`
directory for cleanliness.

The png files are generated by the Gabby package using the
`gabby.cfg`.  The `gabby.tex` file has the command-lines to run to
generate them.  It should be completely deterministic since the PRNGs
are seeded from the config file, and the source data to train the
'statistical model' have matching shasums in there as well.

```bash
make clean all
open BUILD/*.pdf
```
