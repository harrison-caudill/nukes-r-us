    abstract = {The term "Kessler Syndrome" is an orbital debris term
                  that has become popular outside the professional
                  orbital debris community without ever having a
                  strict definition. The intended definition grew out
                  of a 1978 JGR paper predicting that fragments from
                  random collisions between catalogued objects in low
                  Earth orbit would become an important source of
                  small debris beginning in about the year 2000, and
                  that afterwards, "...the debris flux will increase
                  exponentially with time, even though a zero net
                  input may be maintained". The purpose of this paper
                  is to clarify the intended definition of the term,
                  to put the implications into perspective after 30
                  years of research by the international scientific
                  community, and to discuss what this research may
                  mean to future space operations. The conclusion is
                  reached that while popular use of the term may have
                  exaggerated and distorted the conclusions of the
                  1978 paper, the result of all research to date
                  confirms that we are now entering a time when the
                  orbital debris environment will increasingly be
                  controlled by random collisions. Without adequate
                  collision avoidance capabilities, control of the
                  future environment requires that we fully implement
                  current mitigation guidelines by not leaving future
                  payloads and rocket bodies in orbit after their
                  useful life. In addition, we will likely be required
                  to return some objects already in orbit.}
