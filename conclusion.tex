\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Recommendations}
\begin{itemize}

\item Stop trying to ban ASATs - it isn't going to happen
\item Develop SAFEKILLs and encourage enemies to do the same
\item Develop and publish CNC safeguards such as
\item Use of force doctrines
\item Set up a de-escalation hotline for space warfare

\item Train military personnel to ensure the problematic nature of
  these weapons is understood

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Further Research \& Open Questions}
\begin{itemize}

\item enforcement mechanisms?

\item A full analysis of the command-and-control pathways for asat
  systems in the various nations

\item A game-theory analysis of ASAT missiles and what ``civilian
  oversight'' even means WRT launch risk (talk to BBdM, though you'll
  have to pay him)

\item A more sophisticated analysis of sustainable testing policies

\item it might be useful here to outline the game theoretic effects of
  public doctrine (positively stabilizing) as well as destabilizing
  effects from the RAND literature. it's a complex subject but you
  need to back up your assertion that doctrine should be published
  with an analysis of why it would have a stabilizing effect.

\end{itemize}
