\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Recommendations}
Stop trying to ban ASATs - it isn't going to happen
Develop SAFEKILLs and encourage enemies to do the same
Develop and publish CNC safeguards such as
Use of force doctrines


Set up a de-escalation hotline for space warfare
Train military personnel to ensure the problematic nature of these weapons is understood

\subsection{Further Research \& Open Questions}
A full analysis of the command-and-control pathways for asat systems in the various nations
A game-theory analysis of ASAT missiles and what ``civilian oversight'' even means WRT launch risk (talk to BBdM, though you'll have to pay him)
A more sophisticated analysis of sustainable testing policies
it might be useful here to outline the game theoretic effects of public doctrine (positively stabilizing) as well as  destabilizing effects from the RAND literature. it's a complex subject but you need to back up your assertion that doctrine should be published with an analysis of why it would have a stabilizing effect.
