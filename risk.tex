\section{Risk of Use in Combat}

Unused weapons are of little risk to anyone; all of the destructive
potential is avoided if \acp{kasat} go unused.  The novel analysis
below examines the incentive structure around these weapons,
culminating in the unfortunate conclusion that there is a very real
risk of use.

Three aspects of the incentive structure are discussed below:
Efficacy, Availability, and Governance.  While the general consensus
seems to be in agreement that these weapons do pose a very real risk,
none are currently known to examine the incentive structure in a
similar manner.  This examination is critical, as will be seen, in
identifying actionable mitigations.


\subsection{Underlying Premises}

Three specific aspects of the incentive structure around development,
deployment, and use of \acp{kasat} are used: Efficacy, Availability,
and Governance.  These premises are summarized here, but discussed in
further detail in \S\ref{section::support}.

\subsubsection{Efficacy: ASATs are of Strategic Value}
\acp{kasat} are effective at eliminating strategic targets like
surveillance systems or even other \acp{coasat}.  Much like nuclear
weapons on Earth, the incentives to test and field \ac{asat} weapons
are strong.  As a corollary, attempts to ban testing or induce
disarmament will likely meet similar levels of success.

\subsubsection{Availability: Few Alternatives Exist}
Currently there are few publicly-disclosed and/or deployed options for
a permanently disabling attack on a spacecraft that do not generate
debris.  In the event of armed conflict, any inclination to eliminate
a strategic asset in orbit is likely to be satisfiable in one and only
one way: \acp{kasat}.

\subsubsection{Governance: Few \ac{cnc} Safeguards are in Place}
The command-and-control structures for ASAT systems are not generally
known.  While information about safeguards is readily available (or at
least well studied) for nuclear weapons, analogous information does
not exist for \acp{kasat}.  \ac{abm} interceptors whose
usage-doctrines of rapid-response to prevent an incoming \ac{icbm}
from reaching its target can also be used for ASAT missions, adding to
the problem of proliferation.  Combined with disastrous activity in
the past, it seems reasonable to assume that there are few of the same
\ac{cnc} safeguards in place for \ac{asat} systems that are found in
nuclear weapons.  The more prolific the weapons, and the less
controlled they are, the more likely they are to be used.

\subsection{Conclusion: Credible Risk in Conflict}

The specific question under consideration is:

\begin{blockquote}
  In the event of terrestrial kinetic conflict, is there credible risk
  of deployment of \acfp{kasat}?
\end{blockquote}

The question above is specifically worded for several reasons.  For
example, an argument could be made that the United States is already
engaged in a cyber/economic war with China and Russia, but we are not
yet engaged in a ``kinetic war''.  Additionally, it could be argued
that the western world is engaged in a proxy war with Russia via
Ukraine, but again, not a kinetic war.  ``Credible risk'' is the
chosen language as there is always ``some risk'' and never any
``certainty''.

The first step in answering that question is to restate the stated
premises in the proper context of incentives:

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf Efficacy:} There is a well-established motivation to
  neutralize enemy spacecraft in the event of terrestrial
  conflict.\cite{big-risks} \acfp{kasat} accomplish a useful task
  making them attractive military options.

\item {\bf Availability:} Few alternatives exist to fulfill that
  mission making them the primary (if not exclusive) way to get the
  job done.

\item {\bf Governance:} There doesn't seem to be much to stop their
  use in combat.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{blockquote}
  {\bf Conclusion: Yes.  The apparent incentive structure necessitates
    treating the deployment of \acp{kasat} as a credible risk in the
    event of terrestrial kinetic war between major powers.}
\end{blockquote}

There is some amount of subtlety in the word choices above, and some
amount of implied subtlety as well.  For example, it does not quantify
or even qualify the probability of deployment, or discuss the scale of
the conflict necessary.  Like most pronouncements of scientists, the
conclusions presented are nuanced, and hedged.

\subsection{Consensus Opinion}

Few sources could be found that viewed this question in a similar
manner.  However, many other examinations of this topic have been
performed and have come to a similar conclusion: the risk of the world
utilizing \acp{kasat} is real.

As the consensus opinion is in agreement, the conclusion of
\acp{kasat} being a credible risk will be assumed to hold.  Should any
of the premises be found to be incorrect, this conclusion will likely
continue to stand, though the mitigations stemming from those premises
may be called into question.

For example, suppose that premise 3 is actually false, and that the
USA, Russia, and China actually all do have strong safeguards in place
against launching \acp{kasat} with greater earnestness than for
nuclear weapons; the recommended \ac{cnc} safeguards would be
unnecessary.  Even in penning that statement, however, the probability
seems ludicrously low.  Combined with a longstanding tradition of
considering nuclear weapons to be real threats and a stated assumption
that they would be likely used by autocratic leaders who are so armed
rather than permit themselves to lose power\cite[that colonel]{xxx},
the assumption seems reasonable for now.

FIXME: This should be a subsection giving a good overview of how other
analysts have viewed this question and whether or not they agree.  Not
a lot exists out there with a similar construction so we'll probably
focus on the conclusion
