    abstract = {As the number of artificial satellites in earth orbit
                  increases, the probability of collisions between
                  satellites also increases. Satellite collisions
                  would produce orbiting fragments, each of which
                  would increase the probability of further
                  collisions, leading to the growth of a belt of
                  debris around the earth. This process parallels
                  certain theories concerning the growth of the
                  asteroid belt. The debris flux in such an
                  earth-orbiting belt could exceed the natural
                  meteoroid flux, affecting future spacecraft
                  designs. A mathematical model was used to predict
                  the rate at which such a belt might form. Under
                  certain conditions the belt could begin to form
                  within this century and could be a significant
                  problem during the next century. The possibility
                  that numerous unobserved fragments already exist
                  from spacecraft explosions would decrease this time
                  interval. However, early implementation of
                  specialized launch constraints and operational
                  procedures could significantly delay the formation
                  of the belt.},

    abstract = {The term "Kessler Syndrome" is an orbital debris term
                  that has become popular outside the professional
                  orbital debris community without ever having a
                  strict definition. The intended definition grew out
                  of a 1978 JGR paper predicting that fragments from
                  random collisions between catalogued objects in low
                  Earth orbit would become an important source of
                  small debris beginning in about the year 2000, and
                  that afterwards, "...the debris flux will increase
                  exponentially with time, even though a zero net
                  input may be maintained". The purpose of this paper
                  is to clarify the intended definition of the term,
                  to put the implications into perspective after 30
                  years of research by the international scientific
                  community, and to discuss what this research may
                  mean to future space operations. The conclusion is
                  reached that while popular use of the term may have
                  exaggerated and distorted the conclusions of the
                  1978 paper, the result of all research to date
                  confirms that we are now entering a time when the
                  orbital debris environment will increasingly be
                  controlled by random collisions. Without adequate
                  collision avoidance capabilities, control of the
                  future environment requires that we fully implement
                  current mitigation guidelines by not leaving future
                  payloads and rocket bodies in orbit after their
                  useful life. In addition, we will likely be required
                  to return some objects already in orbit.}
