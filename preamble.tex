%% Doing this requires mucking about with an internal macro, whose

%% (catcode) 12, which is a non-letter character.  To muck about with
%% it, we must first switch that character to catcode 11.  When we're
%% done, we can switch it back.  Hence the make-at-letter vs
%% make-at-other commands below.
