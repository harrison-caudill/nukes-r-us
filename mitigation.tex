\section{Mitigation}

\subsection{Mitigation of Premise 1: Unclear}
While there is reason to believe that there are clandestine activities designed to limit the efficacy of KKVs against individual assets, there is little public evidence of these efforts, and even less about wide-scale deployment.  Furthermore, the hypothesized methods below would likely be cost prohibitive for commercial users.  As a thought experiment, consider the following approaches:

Stealth Satellites: Decreasing RADAR cross-sections and IR signatures might make targeting satellites more difficult and improve survivability in the event of an attack.  See Appendix XXX for an approximate SNR budget for the IR camera on the SM-3 interceptor from Raytheon and the hypothesized necessary cooling method for a foreign satellite to evade it.
High Impulse Thrusters: In principle, it might be feasible to incorporate high-impulse thrusters to perform an evasive maneuver.  When coupled with high-accuracy Space Situational Awareness, it could conceivably permit a spacecraft to avoid a collision.
Kinetic Counteroffensive: In Soviet Russia, Satellite Shoots YOU!!!  In 196whatever, the Soviet Union launched and demonstrated a machine gun on a spacecraft.  A relatively simple system such as Metal Storm might be capable of initiating an early breakup of the KKV.  This approach has some obvious difficulties beyond basic execution such as the generation of a large debris field still on track to intersect with its target.
ElectroMagnetic Pulse: Utilizing newer wide bandgap semiconductor systems, it might be possible to deliver an impulse with sufficient field strength to electronically disable the KKV's targeting and maneuvering systems.  Obvious difficulties include things like targeting, and the ability to conduct the Eelectronic Counter Measures (ECM) attack while there is still time to then evade it, especially if the KKV is equipped with an inflatable system.  This technology is currently being fielded by companies such as Epirus.(cite epirus)

The obvious and straightforward methods one might conjure to avoid collision with a modern KKV are, to put it charitably, problematic.  Lacking any obviously viable path to mitigate premise 1, and lacking any public evidence of these efforts, it is assumed that Premise 1 will remain in effect for the foreseeable future.  If KKVs continue to be effective, then there will be continued incentive to use them.

\subsection{Mitigation of Premise 2: Arming Adversaries}
This mitigation is, perhaps, the most disturbing of the three: the world would be a better place if our adversaries had more weapons.  A distinction should be drawn, at this point, between recommending that we provide arms to adversaries, and examining the two scenarios.  This mitigation is more akin to asking if you prefer to drink muddy water or raw sewage - neither scenario is particularly appealing, but there is still a clear winner.

If ASAT missiles cannot be eliminated, are enormously destructive, are poorly governed, and are likely to be used in conflict then the orbital realm is in a very precarious position.  While the world would, undoubtedly, be better off if ASAT missiles did not exist, they do exist, and are only one step removed from cyber-attacks with little or no oversight in the hands of those who have already tested them in an irresponsible manner.(cite analyses of fengyun and nudol)  It is believed that dictatorial leaders such as Xi, Putin, and Kim would likely launch nuclear strikes rather than permit themselves to lose power(cite that paper by that colonel and one other for funsies).  It is hypothesized that military leadership might overrule a nuclear strike order from one of these leaders (XXX: ask michael for citation).  Would they override an ASAT strike order?

Consider, now, the two scenarios:

Irresponsible actors like China and Russia have only ASAT missiles to employ in the event of kinetic war, all but ensuring that they use them.

They have alternative weapons available to them which are less destructive.

Option 2 is clearly less problematic.  While this conclusion is unfortunate, it clearly results in less harm.

There are other issues to consider, such as timing.  For example, if a state of terrestrial kinetic war can be effectively staved off until appropriate mitigations to their efficacy can be developed, then these findings become moot.  However, given the recent rise in tensions between the western world and China/Russia, that scenario seems unlikely.

As a more concrete example of this principle, consider the case of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  If they were armed only with cyber-attacks and nuclear weapons then mushroom clouds would have almost certainly sprouted.  As we saw, however, Russia had tanks and rifles (and expendable riflemen) at their disposal and that is what they chose to use.(citation even necessary?)  While still tragic, Russia's invasion with tanks and rifles is less harmful than an invasion with only nuclear weapons.  The same could be said of an invasion of Taiwan by China.  In the ideal case, these nations would be equipped with offensive technologies that they truly believe are of utility, but in practice can be easily defeated.

The question posed is not whether Russia or China should or should not have ASAT missiles; they are too irresponsible to be entrusted with them but they have them nonetheless.  The question is not whether China will or will not invade Taiwan or whether Russia will or will not invade Ukraine; China has made it quite clear that they intend to and Russia already has.(cite XXX)  The question is not whether or not China/Russia will or will not attack spacecraft; China has already announced that they will, while Russia has already destroyed a spacecraft as an apparent prelude to war and has already conducted cyber attacks against American civilian assets.(cite nudol, viasat)  The question posed is whether the world is a better place with Xi and Putin being largely restricted to the orbital version of nuclear weapons or if the world is perhaps a bit less bleak with those rulers having the space version of conventional arms at their disposal.

Unsavory though the conclusion may be, it is clear that western allies and the world in general (including Russia/China) are better served by ensuring that Russia/China possess alternatives (ideally impotent alternatives).  These alternative systems could disrupt electrical systems, limit maneuverability, occlude sensors and solar panels, or damage radio systems; ultimately anything that eliminates the strategic capability without generating the debris of a KKV would be a much better choice.  A satellite whose batteries have overheated and no longer function, or whose solar panels have been occluded, or whose electrical bus has been shorted is likely to be just as useful to its operators as one which has been turned into a puff of debris.  In combination with the next mitigation (governance) it might be possible to properly incentivize nations to reach for the less destructive alternatives.

Perhaps the best summary of this thought is that, in some sense, it is preferable to equip a child with a stick if they are already in possession of a stick of dynamite.
Proliferation Counterargument
The counterargument to this mitigation is that having less catastrophic options increases the likelihood that they will be used.  The deterrent effects of nuclear weapons are well documented and generally effective.(cite mad)  However, bullets are fired with great regularity.  A corollary is the decades-old debate around the use of tactical nuclear weapons as a battlefield tool, rather than a strategic deterrent.

\subsection{Mitigation of Premise 3: Management not Elimination}
Four nations are known to be capable of launching missiles to destroy spacecraft, and three of them appear poised to form an alliance.(cite nytimes article about india/china/russia)  If any of those four nations finds themselves in an armed conflict with another major power, there will be significant incentive to destroy opposing space assets; Chinese General XXX announced YYY in ZZZ.(dig up the citation from big risks)  In all four of these nations, there is little or no evidence that proper CNC safeguards exist to ensure that the consequences of any strike order are properly understood and that only those responsible parties can act.  Nuclear CNC safeguards, by contrast, are well-studied and known through hard, if terrifyingly close, experience to at least be somewhat effective.(cite stuff)  There is even less evidence of proper civilian oversight and policy to guide those decision-makers, while simultaneously there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that responsible actors are not in positions of appropriate influence in at least two of those nations (Russia and China).  Even worse, it is not even clear that civilian oversight is a meaningful concept in the autocratic nations where this paper's findings most acutely apply: Russia and China.

Despite all of the negatives associated with nuclear weapons, they are still a major part of national arsenals.  They are effective weapons in practice (cite hiroshima) and they are effective deterrents (cite XXX), and it seems unlikely that nations will ever willingly relinquish these capabilities.  While many of the undesirable consequences of nuclear weapons (such as nuclear fallout) possess analogs to the effcts of KKVs (such as debris fields), it seems likely that they will continue to be a part of national arsenals for the same reasons that nuclear weapons will.  One critical difference between ASAT missiles and nuclear weapons, however, is that treaties governing the testing and use of nuclear weapons exist in addition to national defense strategies etc.  Generally speaking, the world has some idea about how it would respond to the use of nuclear weapons during war.  As President Biden recently announced, ``XXX''.

If ASAT weapons are of great strategic value, and are as unlikely to be eliminated as their most closely related strategic weapons, then perhaps attempts to ban them are in vain.  It is therefore proposed that ASAT missile test and usage be managed and mitigated by international treaty, rather than eliminated entirely.

If one assumes that the odds of banning these weapons is very close to zero, then pursuing that end is essentially equivalent to doing nothing and accepting what may come.  Alternatively, management of these weapons may yet be possible.  While highly imperfect, and perhaps better regarded as a mess, nuclear weapons do receive some amount of governance and oversight.  Using the history of successes and failures in nuclear disarmament efforts, it may be possible to enact treaties which constrain the testing and use of ASAT missiles.

Arguably, elimination of these weapons is impossible while management of them is merely quite difficult.  If management stops even a single high-altitude ASAT missile launch, then it can be said to have been beneficial.
