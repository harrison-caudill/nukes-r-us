\section{Mitigation}

\subsection{Mitigation of Premise 1: Unclear}
While there is reason to believe that there are clandestine efforts
designed to limit the efficacy of \acp{kkv} against individual assets,
there is little public evidence of these efforts, and even less about
wide-scale deployment.  Furthermore, the hypothesized methods below
would likely be cost prohibitive for commercial users.  As a thought
experiment, consider the following approaches:

\textbf{Stealth Satellites:} Decreasing RADAR cross-sections and IR
signatures might make targeting satellites more difficult and improve
survivability in the event of an attack.  As the Union of Concerned
Scientists found, a surface temperature close to the boiling point of
liquid Nitrogen would likey be appropriate.\cite[p48]{abm-me-not}

\textbf{High Impulse Thrusters:} In principle, it might be feasible to
incorporate high-impulse thrusters to perform an evasive maneuver.
When coupled with high-accuracy Space Situational Awareness, it could
conceivably permit a spacecraft to avoid a collision.

\textbf{Kinetic Counteroffensive:} In 1974, the Soviet Union launched
and demonstrated a machine gun on the Salyut-3 spacecraft.  A
relatively simple system such as Metal Storm might be capable of
initiating an early breakup of the \ac{kkv}.  This approach has some
obvious difficulties beyond basic execution such as the generation of
a large debris field still on track to intersect with its target.

\textbf{\acl{ecm}:} Utilizing newer wide bandgap semiconductor
systems, it might be possible to deliver an impulse with sufficient
field strength to electronically disable the \acpos{kkv} targeting and
maneuvering systems.  Obvious difficulties include things like
targeting, and the ability to conduct the \ac{ecm} attack while there
is still time to then evade it, especially if the KKV is equipped with
an inflatable system.  This technology is currently being fielded by
companies such as Epirus.\cite[epirus]{xxx}

The obvious and straightforward methods one might conjure to avoid
collision with a modern \ac{kkv} are, to put it charitably,
problematic.  Lacking any obviously viable path to mitigate premise 1,
and lacking any public evidence of these efforts, it is assumed that
Premise 1 will remain in effect for the foreseeable future.  If
\acp{kasat} continue to be effective, then there will be continued
incentive to use them.

\subsection{Mitigation of Premise 2: Arming Adversaries}
This mitigation is, perhaps, the most disturbing of the three: the
world would be a better place if our adversaries had more weapons.
More specifically, the risk of Kessler Syndrome would be lessened if
all nations (most especially Russia and China) were in possession of a
\acf{ssup} that is non-kinetic in nature.  A distinction should be
drawn, at this point, between recommending that we provide arms to
adversaries, and examining the two scenarios.  This mitigation is more
akin to asking if someone if they would prefer to drink muddy water or
poison - neither scenario is particularly appealing, but there is
still a clear winner.

If \acp{kasat} cannot be eliminated, are enormously destructive, are
poorly governed, and are likely to be used in conflict then the
orbital realm is in a very precarious position.  While the world
would, undoubtedly, be better off if ASAT missiles did not exist, they
do exist.  It is hypothesized that military leadership might overrule
a nuclear strike order from dictatorial leaders (XXX: ask michael for
citation).  Would they override a \ac{kasat} strike order?

Consider, now, the two scenarios:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Irresponsible actors like China and Russia have only \acp{kasat}
  to employ in the event of kinetic war, all but ensuring that they
  use them.

\item They have alternative weapons available to them which are less
  destructive.
\end{enumerate}

Option 2 is clearly less problematic.  While this conclusion is
unfortunate, it would likely result in reduced harm.

Unsavory though the conclusion may be, it is clear that western allies
and the world in general (including Russia/China) are better served by
ensuring that Russia/China possess alternatives (ideally impotent
alternatives).  These alternative systems could disrupt electrical
systems, limit maneuverability, occlude sensors and solar panels, or
damage radio systems; ultimately anything that eliminates the
strategic capability without generating the debris of a KKV would be a
much better choice.  A satellite whose batteries have overheated and
no longer function, or whose solar panels have been occluded, or whose
electrical bus has been shorted is likely to be just as useful to its
operators as one which has been turned into a puff of debris.  In
combination with the next mitigation (governance) it might be possible
to properly incentivize nations to reach for the less destructive
alternatives.

There are other issues to consider, such as timing.  For example, if a
state of terrestrial kinetic war can be effectively staved off until
appropriate mitigations to their efficacy can be developed, then these
findings could become moot.  However, given the recent rise in
tensions between the western world and China/Russia, that scenario
seems unlikely.  Furthermore, it could be argued that having less
catastrophic options increases the likelihood that those weapons will
be used.  The deterrent effects of nuclear weapons are well documented
and generally effective.\cite[mad]{xxx} However, bullets are fired
with great regularity.

The question posed is not whether Russia or China should or should not
have ASAT missiles; they are too irresponsible to be entrusted with
them but they have them nonetheless.  The question is not whether
China will or will not invade Taiwan or whether Russia will or will
not invade Ukraine; China has made it quite clear that they intend to
and Russia already has.(cite XXX) The question is not whether or not
China/Russia will or will not attack spacecraft; China has already
announced that they will, while Russia has already destroyed a
spacecraft as an apparent prelude to war and has already conducted
cyber attacks against American civilian assets.(cite nudol, viasat)
The question posed is whether the world is a better place with Xi and
Putin being largely restricted to the orbital version of nuclear
weapons or if the world is perhaps a bit less bleak with those rulers
having the space version of conventional arms at their disposal.

Perhaps the best summary of this thought is that, in some sense, it is
preferable to equip a child with a stick if they are already in
possession of a stick of dynamite.


\subsection{Mitigation of Premise 3: Management not Elimination}
Four nations are known to be capable of launching missiles to destroy
spacecraft, and three of them appear poised to form an alliance.(cite
nytimes article about india/china/russia) If any of those four nations
finds themselves in an armed conflict with another major power, there
will be significant incentive to destroy opposing space assets;
Chinese General XXX announced YYY in ZZZ.(dig up the citation from big
risks) In all four of these nations, there is little or no evidence
that proper \ac{cnc} safeguards exist to ensure that the consequences
of any strike order are properly understood and that only those
responsible parties can act.  Nuclear \ac{cnc} safeguards, by
contrast, are well-studied and known through hard, if terrifyingly
close, experience to at least be somewhat effective.\cite[ask foster
  for a recommendation]{xxx} There is even less evidence of proper
civilian oversight and policy to guide those decision-makers, while
simultaneously there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that
responsible actors are not in positions of appropriate influence in at
least two of those nations (Russia and China).  Even worse, it is not
even clear that civilian oversight is a meaningful concept in the
autocratic nations where this paper's findings most acutely apply:
Russia and China.\cite{dictator}

Despite all of the negatives associated with nuclear weapons, they are
still a major part of national arsenals.  They are effective weapons
in practice (cite hiroshima) and they are effective deterrents (cite
XXX), and it seems unlikely that nations will ever willingly
relinquish these capabilities.  One critical difference between
\acp{kasat} and nuclear weapons, however, is that treaties governing
the testing and use of nuclear weapons exist in addition to national
defense strategies etc.  Generally speaking, the world has some idea
about how it would respond to the use of nuclear weapons during war.
\cite[biden's statement]{xxx}

If \acp{kasat} are of great strategic value, and are as unlikely to be
eliminated as their most closely related strategic weapons, then
perhaps attempts to ban them are in vain.  It is therefore proposed
that \acp{kasat} test and usage be managed and mitigated by
international treaty, rather than eliminated entirely.

If one assumes that the odds of banning these weapons is very close to
zero, then pursuing that end is essentially equivalent to doing
nothing and accepting what may come.  Alternatively, management of
these weapons may yet be possible.  While highly imperfect, and
perhaps better regarded as a mess, nuclear weapons do receive some
amount of governance and oversight.  Using the history of successes
and failures in nuclear disarmament efforts, it may be possible to
enact treaties which constrain the testing and use of \acp{kasat}.

Arguably, elimination of these weapons is impossible while management
of them is merely quite difficult.  If management stops even a single
high-altitude \ac{kasat} launch, then it can be said to have been
beneficial.
